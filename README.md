## **About the Project**

This project is a **fully functional calculator** built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as part of *The Odin Project's* Foundations course. The goal was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals by applying them in a real-world project. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and keyboard input.

## **Features**

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Supports decimal inputs and negative numbers.
- Clear the screen using the "Clear" button.
- Responsive design, making the calculator functional on mobile devices.
- Supports keyboard inputs for easier use.

## **Built With**

- **HTML5**: Structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including layout and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality of the calculator, such as performing calculations and handling user input.
